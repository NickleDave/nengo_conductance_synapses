        Constructor of the LifRateCond neuron class. Copies the given parameters
        and instantiates the internal state vectors. State vectors hold the
        membrane potential, the refractory time, and the conductivity of the
        excitatory and inhibitory synapses for each individual neuron.

        n_neurons: number of neurons in the population.
        tau_rc: membrane time constant of the underlying LIF neuron
        tau_ref: refractory period of the underlying LIF neuron
        e_rev_E: reversal potential of the excitatory synapse. Potentials are
        normalised in such a way that a value zero corresponds to the resting
        potential and a value of one to the threshold potential.

        using a simple linear estimation. If False, takes the non-linearity in
